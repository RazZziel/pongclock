This directory contains the MacOS-specific code for building a Cocoa
version of xscreensaver without using X11.

executables will show up in the "build/Release/" and/or "build/Debug/"
directories.

To build these programs, XCode 2.2 or later is required.
To run them, MacOS 10.4.0 or later is required.
