.TH XScreenSaver 1 "20-Mar-2005 (4.21)" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
xscreensaver-getimage-file - put a randomly-selected image on the root window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xscreensaver-getimage-file
[\-display \fIhost:display.screen\fP] [\--verbose] [\--name] directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxscreensaver\-getimage\-file\fP program is a helper program
for the xscreensaver hacks that manipulate images.  Specifically, it
is invoked by
.BR xscreensaver\-getimage (1)
as needed.  This is not a user-level command.

This program selects a random image from disk, and loads it on the root
window.  It does this by figuring out which image-loading programs are
installed on the system, and invoking the first one it finds.
.SH OPTIONS
.I xscreensaver-getimage-file
accepts the following options:
.TP 4
.B --verbose
Print diagnostics.
.TP 4
.B --name
Don't load an image: instead just print the file name to stdout.
.TP 4
.I directory
The directory to search.   The directory will be searched recursively,
and all files in it are assumed to be images.
