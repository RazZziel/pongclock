  <_description>
A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles.
Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same
slow rate.  Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as
well as the aggregate intersections of the circles.

Though actually it doesn't look like circles at all!
