This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are
the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed
of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of
six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of
eight cubes, each touching six others.  To make it easier to
visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of
each face.  Don't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.

See also "polytopes" for a more general version of this using OpenGL.

Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
