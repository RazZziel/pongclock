SphereEversion draws an animation of a sphere being turned inside out.
A sphere can be turned inside out, without any tears, sharp creases or
discontinuities, if the surface of the sphere is allowed to intersect
itself.  This program animates what is known as the Thurston Eversion.
This program is not included with the XScreenSaver package, but if you
don't have it already, you can find it at
