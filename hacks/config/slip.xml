  <_description>
This program throws some random bits on the screen, then sucks them
through a jet engine and spews them out the other side.  To avoid
turning the image completely to mush, every now and then it will it
interject some splashes of color into the scene, or go into a spin
cycle, or stretch the image like taffy.

Written by Scott Draves and Jamie Zawinski; 1997.
